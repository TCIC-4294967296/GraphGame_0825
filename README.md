# GraphGame_0825
A casual game for two. There are many cities in the game, and the protagonist Mario needs to get from City #0 to the designated end city, some of which are connected by streets, and the two players take turns to control Mario, and finally the one who reaches the end city wins. Inspired by the "directed graph game" in game theory.
